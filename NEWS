0.1.2
Missing values (-9999 and -9999.00) are coded as NA_integer and NA_real during import by read_ef_file. Previously they were replaced to NA_real after importing the files by read_ef_files. Integer variables are not forced to double during the replacement of -9999L to NA_real. Unfortunately fluxes files may code -9999.99 as missing values for integer variables. While upon importing those missing values are converted to NA, the entire variable is imported as double.
