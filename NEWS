0.2.2
Removed dirdf dependency as it looks like it is no longer maintained. The dirdf package dirdf_parse function along with some helper functions were integrated in efreadr package code
0.2.1
First support for L2 flux files
0.2.0
Combinations of aggregation/levels are now kept separate. A dataframe of level, aggregation and fluxes variables is returned. The fluxes dataframe holds data imported from unique combinations of level/aggregation files.
File names are parsed thanks to dirdf package and added as metadata variables in the returned dataframe (eg year, country_id, site_id, version, etc.).
0.1.2
Missing values (-9999 and -9999.00) are coded as NA_integer and NA_real during import by read_ef_file. Previously they were replaced to NA_real after importing the files by read_ef_files. Integer variables are not forced to double during the replacement of -9999L to NA_real. Unfortunately fluxes files may code -9999.99 as missing values for integer variables. While upon importing those missing values are converted to NA, the entire variable is imported as double.
0.1.1
Changed package title
Fixed bug with date conversion in hourly files
